# Theme Management Handle Project

## 🚀 Overview

This project was developed as a proof of concept for managing themes within a web application. While the implementation lays a foundation, achieving greater dynamism and efficient component management would require a fresh start with a more structured approach.

## ⚙️ Key Configuration

### `baseCheckout`

The `baseCheckout` variable is the core setting for managing the checkout base URL in the application. You can modify its value in the following file:

**File Path:** `app/page.tsx`

**Example:**

```typescript
const baseCheckout = "your-new-base-url";
```

## 📈 Future Improvements

This project successfully demonstrates the concept of theme handling. However, to achieve better flexibility, maintainability, and scalability, a fresh approach with a more robust project structure would be ideal. This would enable greater dynamism and efficient component management.
